pslibrary.0.1 (ADC, Aug. 2010)

First release of the pseudopotential library. The following PPs 
are available:

H, B, C, N, O, F, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, Fe, Ni, Ag, Pt, Au, Pb.

---------------------------------------------------------
pslibrary.0.2 (ADC, Feb. 2011)

The following PPs have been added to the library:

Li, Be, Na, Cu, Ga, As, Se, Br, Mo, Cd, Sn, I, Hf, Ta

---------------------------------------------------------
pslibrary.0.2.1 (ADC, May 2011)

A ghost in the Li PP has been removed. 

The Fe PP substituted with a PP with 3s and 3p semicore states.

Added an input file for the generation of norm conserving PPs with the same
core radii suggested in the Troullier and Martins (TM) atomic code.

--------------------------------------------------------
pslibrary.0.2.2 (ADC, Aug. 2011)

Introduced the possibility to generate the PP for only one element and
for all functionals. Edit the file make_ps and choose the element, then
run make_all_ps.

Introduced the possibility to have different parameters in the scalar 
relativistic (SR) or in the fully relativistic (FR) case. 

SR changes: Pb

FR changes: Al, Pb 

SR additions: Pd, Ge, In, Te, Bi, Zn, Hg

FR additions: Pd, Ge, In, Te, Bi, Zn, Hg

Removed PPs:
In the NC case Cu and W were not working. 

--------------------------------------------------------
pslibrary.0.2.3 (ADC, Dic. 2011)

SR changes: NC-PP Ge and Sn PPs had a ghost. Improved PPs.

Introduced two additional files with PAW and US PP inputs for remaining
elements:

 Ar At Ba Ca Ce Co Cr Cs He Ir K Kr La Mg Mn Nb Ne Os Po Rb Rh Re Ru Sb
 Sc Sr Tc Ti Tl V Xe Y W Zr

These PPs are known to have some problem in some case (mainly in the FR form)
and need further tuning, but are a starting point for further optimization,
so use them at your own risk. 
In order to add also these PPs to your list uncomment the appropriate lines
in make_ps.

--------------------------------------------------------
pslibrary.0.2.4 (ADC, Jan 2012)

Reorganization of the documentation.
Names of the PPs now conform to the QE recommendations.

SR + FR changes: NC-PP: Sb and As had not SO projectors in the p channel 
(which was local). Now d is local. 
NC-PP: Ga with 3d in valence was too hard. Substituted with a 
PP with 3d in the core.

SR + FR changes: NC-PP: Ge had not SO projectors in the (local) p channel.
Now d is local.
NC-PP: Relativistic Sn had still a ghost. Core radii increased.

SR + FR changes : NC-PP In had a ghost.

PP transferred from the _tot file to the main file: Rh (SR+FR), Ir (SR+FR), Ar 

PPs names now follows the indications of the QE PP distribution. Semicore
states included in the PP are indicated in the PP name.

Added two files containing alternative PPs. Presently:
Fe : SR and FR without semicore 3s and 3p states.
Pt : SR and FR PPs with semicore 5s and 5p states.
Au : SR and FR PPs with semicore 5s and 5p states.

--------------------------------------------------------
pslibrary.0.2.5 (ADC, WORK IN PROGRESS)

Added PPs FR + SR: Mg with semicore 2s and 2p states has been added to the
alternative PPs.

Rh and V names were not correct in the paw case.

Bug fix: The alternative Pt and Au inputs produced always scalar 
relativistic data sets.

Scripts updated to QE 5.0.
