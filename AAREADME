This directory contains a collection of input files for the ld1.x
atomic code which is distributed with the Quantum ESPRESSO package
(See http://www.quantum-espresso.org).
It allows the generation of PAW data-sets or US pseudopotentials,
scalar relativistic or fully relativistic, for several elements. 
To generate the pseudopotentials, you need to change the file make_ps 
inserting the path to the QE package.
Then give the command:

. ./make_all_ps

to create the PPs for the pz, pbe, rel-pz and rel-pbe functionals,
or enter in a "functional" directory and give the command:

. ../make_ps

The UPF pseudopotentials will appear in the directory
 functional/PSEUDOPOTENTIALS. 
See the file Modules/funct.f90 in the QE distribution for a list of the
available functionals. 
NB: Only LDA or GGA PPs can be created by the ld1.x code so no hybrid 
functional, or meta-GGA PPs is presently available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that these pseudopotentials are experimental. 
By default, only PAW data-sets and US-PPs that are in 

 paw_ps_collection.job
 us_ps_collection.job

are generated. These PPs have been tested in some cases and no error 
has been reported so far. The PPs that were in pslibrary.0.1 
(See ChangeLog file) have been tested extensively, the others are 
under test right now. Only the pz, pbe, rel-pz and rel-pbe functionals
have been tested. Please report any problem that you find with the
other functionals.

PAW data-sets and US-PPs that are in

paw_ps_collection_tot.job
us_ps_collection_tot.job

have not been tested or if tested have been found to have at least
one problem (mainly in the FR case). However a few bugs have been found 
in the pw.x code and some of the apparent PP problems might be now corrected. 

For testing purposes, starting with version 0.2.1 also the TM norm 
conserving radii are distributed. 
(NB: these radii have been originally imported from the file
distributed with the Troullier and Martins (TM) atomic code.
See http://bohr.inesc-mn.pt/~jlm/pseudo.html
but they have not been tested. The file is maintained so improvement are 
continuously made. However the status of this part of the library is far 
from complete.)

Please report to the pw_forum or to me any problem that you find.
