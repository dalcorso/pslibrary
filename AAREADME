This directory contains a collection of input files for the ld1.x
code distributed with the Quantum-ESPRESSO package. It
allows the generation of PAW datasets or US pseudopotentials,
scalar relativistic or fully relativistic, for several elements. 
To generate the pseudopotentials change the file make_ps inserting
the path to the QE package.
Then give the command:

. ./make_all_ps

or enter in one  "functional" directory  and give the command:

. ../make_ps

The UPF pseudopotentials will appear in the directories 
functional/PSEUDOPOTENTIALS.

Note that these pseudopotentials are very experimental. 
They use new features of the ld1.x code that are not extensively
tested.
So check them very carefully before using and please give feedback
if you find better sets of parameters or if some property turns
out to be wrong.
