This directory contains a collection of input files for the ld1.x
code distributed with the Quantum ESPRESSO package. It
allows the generation of PAW datasets or US pseudopotentials,
scalar relativistic or fully relativistic, for several elements. 
Starting with version 0.2.1 also the TM norm conserving radii are
distributed for the generation of NC pseudopotentials.
To generate the pseudopotentials change the file make_ps inserting
the path to the QE package.
Then give the command:

. ./make_all_ps

or enter in one  "functional" directory  and give the command:

. ../make_ps

The UPF pseudopotentials will appear in the directories 
functional/PSEUDOPOTENTIALS.

Note that these pseudopotentials are very experimental. 
They use new features of the ld1.x code that are not extensively
tested.
So check them very carefully before using and please give feedback
if you find better sets of parameters or if some property turns
out to be wrong.

pslibrary.0.1 (ADC, Aug. 2010)

First release of the pseudopotential library. The following PPs are available:

H, B, C, N, O, F, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, Fe, Ni, Ag, Pt, Au, Pb.

pslibrary.0.2 (ADC, Feb. 2011)

The following PPs have been added to the library:

Li, Be, Na, Cu, Ga, As, Se, Br, Mo, Cd, Sn, I, Hf, Ta

---------------------------------------------------------
pslibrary.0.2.1 (ADC, May 2011)

A ghost in the Li PP has been removed. 

The Fe PP substituted with a PP with 3s and 3p semicore states.

Added an input file for the generation of norm conserving PPs with the same
core radii suggested in the Troullier and Martins (TM) atomic code.

--------------------------------------------------------
pslibrary.0.2.2 (ADC, In progress)

Introduced the possibility to have different parameters in the scalar 
relativistic (SR) or in the fully relativistic (FR) case. 

SR changes:

FR changes:

Pb 

SR additions:

FR additions:

Removed PPs:
In the NC case Cu and W were not working. Removed.
