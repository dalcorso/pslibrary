This directory contains a collection of input files of the ld1.x
code for the generation of PAW datasets or US pseudopotentials for 
several elements. 
To generate the pseudopotentials change the file make_ps inserting
the path to the ld1.x code.
Then give the command:

. ./make_all_ps

The UPF pseudopotentials will appear in the directories 
functional/PSEUDOPOTENTIALS.

Note that these pseudopotentials are very experimental. 
They use new features of the ld1.x code that are not extensively
tested.
So check them very carefully before using and give feedback
if you find better sets of parameters or if some property turns
out to be wrong.
